# Weather_Data_Pipeline

- ** This is the basic python code where we move the data from local to s3 bucket with the help of the boto3 fucntion **
- ** We need to setup the aws cli where we have to give the aws user credential to test the data flow from local to the s3 bucket.
- Here the AWS user is the IAM user where we give the rquired permission to the user to access the specific AWS service.
